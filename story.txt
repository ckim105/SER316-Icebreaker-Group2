I was at the local ratskeller with my hund and we were having a good time when suddenly
Someone ran and threw an apfelkuchen right at my face
As the person ran away I noticed it was a little girl wearing a dirndel
I went outside to see that she thrown a huge gebaeck at my convertible BMW as well
There was some bratwurst and brot on the car too
She paused for a moment before running into a nearby baeckerei
And then came outside with the most aggressive hund I have ever seen
I tried to calm it with from doener from Raesfeld
I was done, I got into my BMW and drove off...I am so glad I didn't come out in my Porche
I decided to treat myself with some apfelkuchen
Feeling a little down, I decided to go back to my extravagant, ultra-expensive Schloss
It was a hot day, so I'm glad my schloss has a klimaanlage.
That's when I figured the newly installed Klimaanlage does not work anymore.
I got a good deal on it too, since the klimaanlage market in town is very wettbewerbsfaehig.
